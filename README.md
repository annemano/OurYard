## Introduction
This is a clone of an Airbnb-type app. It was built over 4 days at Le Wagon coding bootcamp (spring 2021) with a team of 4 (@jean-colombel, @danielsilverman, Luis Batista and myself).

## Highlights
Some of the main work I've done on the app:
- Managed the user stories, daily stand-ups and kanban board (Trello) as lead dev in a team of 4
- Worked mainly on the back-end, setting up the database, MVC, user authentication with Devise, Active Storage and Cloudinary for image uploads, AJAX for real-time status updates and deployment on Heroku
- Used Javascript to make the front-end more dynamic (e.g. total price calculation)
- Implemented the review system

## Improvements Needed
- Improve front-end styling of the index page, My Bookings and My Listings
- Implement unavailable/fully booked dates logic
- Notification system for bookings
- Review system for owner to rate bookers
- Review logic so that a review can only be left after stay
